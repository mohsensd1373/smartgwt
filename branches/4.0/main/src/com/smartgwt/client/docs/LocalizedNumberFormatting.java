 * <h3>Localized Number Formatting</h3>
 * These SimpleTypes automatically use GWT's NumberFormat logic, using the default locale, and
 * further SimpleTypes can be created that call GWT's NumberFormat if more variations are needed.
 * <p> Locale files contain properties such as "decimalSymbol" that seemingly would control
 * localized number formatting, but these properties are not used in SGWT and should be ignored.
