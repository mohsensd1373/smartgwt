/**
 * This string is the base CSS class name applied to a FormItem (or some part of a form item). The style name will be
 * modified as the 'state' of the form item changes. Specifically:<ul> <li>If {@link
 * com.smartgwt.client.widgets.form.fields.FormItem#getShowFocused showFocused} is true, when the form item receives focus,
 * this     style will have the suffix "Focused" appended to it.</li> <li>If {@link
 * com.smartgwt.client.widgets.form.fields.FormItem#getShowErrorStyle showErrorStyle} is true, if the form item has errors,
 * this     style will have the suffix "Error" appended to it.</li> <li>If {@link
 * com.smartgwt.client.widgets.form.fields.FormItem#getShowDisabled showDisabled} is true, when the form item is disabled,
 * this     style will have the suffix "Disabled" appended to it.</li> <li>Finally, if {@link
 * com.smartgwt.client.widgets.form.fields.FormItem#getShowRTL showRTL} is true, when the form item is in RTL mode, this   
 * style will have the suffix "RTL" appended to it.</ul> So for example if the cellStyle for some form item is set to
 * "formCell" and showFocused is true, when the form item receives focus, the form item's cell will have the
 * "formCellFocused" style applied to it.
