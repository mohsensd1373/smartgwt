Introduction
------------
This example illustrates various 'easy to follow' examples illustrating some of SmartGWT capabilities.

Setup
-----
 - set the GWT_HOME environment variable to point to your GWT SDK directory

- This example users ant to build the war. You will need to have the Ant 'bin' in your PATH. If you do not have Ant, you can either download it 
  from http://ant.apache.org/ or simply point to the Ant distribution bundled in your SmartGWT distribution. It is located under the
  'apache-ant-1.7.1' directory.  The following assumes 'ant' is on your command line path.
    
      o To run hosted mode, just type 'ant hosted'.
      o To compile your project for deployment, just type 'ant'.      
      o To compile and also bundle into a .war file, type 'ant war'.

  
- The command 'ant war' build a war. Deploy in in your web container and access the sample by hitting the URL
